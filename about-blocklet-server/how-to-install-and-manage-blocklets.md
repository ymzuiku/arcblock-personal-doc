## Install

To install a Blocklet on the Blocklet Server, all you need is a URL that follows the Blocklet format. This can be a link to a local file or any valid URL. However, most of the time, we install Blocklets directly from the Blocklet Store.

## Run / Stop / Update

You can run, stop, or update each Blocklet easily from the Blocklet Server management page.

## Backup

We use a Blocklet called DID Space to back up Blocklet data. Usually, we store this data in a DID Space provided by ArcBlock.

## Delete

To delete a Blocklet, you remove it from the server. When deleting, you can choose to keep the data or remove the data along with the Blocklet.
